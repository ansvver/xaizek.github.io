    <p>This day I finally made a decision to start posting some notes on computer
related stuff and mainly about how I solved some minor issues with software.
Several month ago I already picked statically generated sites and GitHub pages
as a hosting (I don&#39;t expect other people to read this, I just don&#39;t want to
forget anything of it :-), so such hosting is enough for my needs).  So I found
a post <a href="http://davidwinter.me/articles/2011/10/29/setting-up-github-pages/">Setting up Github Pages</a> written by David Winter and started
following steps described there.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I failed at the very first step with command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">echo</span> -n
</code></pre></div>
<p>And got this error message from <code>gem</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash language-bash" data-lang="bash">WARNING:  Error fetching data: Errno::ECONNREFUSED: Connection refused - connect<span class="o">(</span>2<span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">(</span>http://rubygems.org/latest_specs.4.8.gz<span class="o">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I tried using <code>wget</code> to download the file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash language-bash" data-lang="bash">wget http://rubygems.org/latest_specs.4.8.gz
</code></pre></div>
<p>and it worked greatly.  So the next thing to try was running some of <code>gem</code>
commands that work locally:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash language-bash" data-lang="bash">gem list --local
gem list -l
</code></pre></div>
<p>Which are worked fine, while these commands:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash language-bash" data-lang="bash">gem list --remote
gem list -r
</code></pre></div>
<p>failed just like <code>gem install jekyll</code>.  After searching on the Internet to find
out possible reason on an issue a note about possibly incorrect setup proxy was found (<a href="http://osdir.com/ml/ruby-core/2010-06/msg00331.html">here</a>).  I
didn&#39;t actually use any proxy, but since I was playing with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privoxy">privoxy</a> some
time ago and remembered something about <code>$HTTP_PROXY</code> environment variable I
decided to check contents of my <code>~/.bashrc</code> and <code>~/.profile</code> and found this line
in the <code>~/.profile</code> file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">HTTP_PROXY</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;http://127.0.0.1:8118&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I don&#39;t know why other software didn&#39;t complain about not working proxy, it
seems like it just tried to use the proxy and then silently switched to direct
connection configuration.</p>

<p>Anyway, after removing that line from the <code>~/.profile</code> and running</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="bash language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">unset </span>HTTP_PROXY
</code></pre></div>
<p>command in the working terminal I was able to successfully install <code>jekyll</code> gem.</p>
